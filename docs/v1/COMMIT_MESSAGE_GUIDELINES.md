# Commit Message Guidelines

A good commit message should be descriptive and provide context about the changes made. This makes it easier to understand and review the changes in the future.

## Commit Message Types

Use the following commit types to describe your changes:

| Type     | Description                                       |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| feat     | A new feature or enhancement to existing functionality. |
| fix      | A bug fix or correction of an issue.               |
| docs     | Documentation updates (e.g., README, comments).    |
| style    | Code style changes (e.g., formatting, indentation). |
| refactor | Code refactoring or restructuring without changing functionality. |
| perf     | Performance improvements.                          |
| test     | Adding or modifying tests.                         |
| chore    | Routine tasks, maintenance, or tooling changes.    |

## Examples

Here are some examples of well-formatted commit messages:

- `feat: Add new endpoint for user authentication`
- `fix: Resolve issue with broken layout on mobile devices`
- `docs: Update installation instructions`
- `style: Format code according to style guide`
- `refactor: Improve database connection handling`
- `test: Add test suite for authentication service`
- `chore: Upgrade dependencies to the latest versions`

## Additional Tips

- Keep commit messages concise and to the point.

- Use present tense in your messages (Use imperative mood for the summary) `e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature"`.

- Separate the subject from the body of your message with a blank line when necessary.

- Reference issues, if applicable, using the format "Fixes #123" or "Closes #456."

- Start with a short summary of the changes made in the commit.

- Provide additional details in the commit message body, if necessary. This could include the reason for the change, the impact of the change, or any dependencies that were introduced or removed.

- Keep the message within 72 characters per line to ensure that it's easy to read in Git log output.

***Remember, writing descriptive commit messages can save time and frustration in the future, and help others understand the changes made to the codebase.***
